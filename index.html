    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I hold a degree in Mathematics from the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Porto; 
       a doctorate in Statistics and Risk Management - Specialization in Statistics, from NOVA School of Science and Technology (FCT-NOVA), since 2016; 
       and have been a Fulbright member since 2014. Currently, I am an integrated member of the Centre for Mathematics and Applications (NOVA Math) at FCT-NOVA, 
       an integrated member of the Naval Research Centre (CINAV) of the Navy, and I collaborate on the Mar-IA Project, developed by NOVA IMS, in partnership with the Hydrographic Institute.</p>
    <h3>Professional Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coordinator of Scientific Production of CINAV</li>
        <li>Team member responsible for the construction of the new Naval laboratory of the Navy (CINAVLab)</li>
        <li>Contact Point (POC) for the protocol established between the Navy and NOVA Math under the project PREFERENTIAL - Improving spatial estimation and survey design through preferential sampling in fishery and biological applications, funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology (PTDC/MAT-STA/28243/2017).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
    <p>I have held teaching positions in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom (2008/2009), in Guinea-Bissau (2005 - 2008), and in Portugal (2009 - 2012), and in higher education institutions, including ISEG (2023-current), FCT-NOVA (2012 - 2014, 2017/2018, and 2022), the Naval Academy (2016 - 2022), and the Military Academy (2016 - 2018).</p>
    <h3>Research Supervision</h3>
    <p>During this period, I supervised/co-supervised 15 master's theses (Naval Academy, FCT-NOVA, and Instituto Superior Técnico) and am currently supervising/co-supervising another 2.</p>
    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>Since 2016, I have been developing work in the field of Statistics, especially in the area of Statistical Disclosure Control, notably having published an article in the prestigious Journal of the American Statistical Association and having been a special guest to present my work at the US Census Bureau in Washington. I also develop work in the field of Decision Support Systems and Data Mining (with applications to naval military sciences and engineering and creation of complex datasets for the scientific community), mostly related to master's theses, focusing on the processing of medium and large-sized databases, georeferenced data, and the application of machine learning techniques, especially using the Python language.</p>
    <h3>Additional Roles</h3>
    <p>From 2016 to 2019, I held the position of assistant to the Director of CINAV, with the particular responsibility of managing the application processes for research project funds.</p>
